```

6. Set command line tools by opening XCode application. 

7. Resolve compabitility issue between XCode10 and React client. Navigate to your project root, and run these. 
```python
$ cd node_modules/react-native/scripts && ./ios-install-third-party.sh && cd ../../../
$ cd node_modules/react-native/third-party/glog-0.3.5/ && ../../scripts/ios-configure-glog.sh && cd ../../../../

# Functionality #
The main idea of this app is that users can vote on the same bills that our House and Senate representatives vote on and see how much they align with a particular legislators.
In particular we provide an interface in the home page for users to vote on new bills currently ont he house and senate floor. Once the real vote happens the user can view a map of how legislators voted and in their profile page users can see how their votes matched with legislators they follow.
In addition they can see all of their past votes in the home page.  
# Usage Guide #
To use the app follow the installation instructions above. Once the App is running create a login by clicking "Sign Up". You can then use this to login and "Start Tracking the Votes". 

# Design Review #
See other document. DesignReview.pdf. 
We have implemented the core functionalities that we proposed. This includes being able to vote on bills, view bill descriptions, compare one's voting history with those of other senators via a match percentage, login and authentication, and data visualization of senator votes. In terms of functionality that was proposed but not implemented, we did not provide the APIs needed for those who want to get data about votes and legislators.
